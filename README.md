# TLHcrs_finder
This repository contains scripts/tools in order to detect Telomere-Linked-Helicase Containing RegionS (TLHcrs) repeats

TLHcrs repeats are, as the name describes, regions adjacent to telomeres that are conserved across chromosome ends and generally contain helicase genes <br/>
These repeats, such as the most perhaps most well known Y-prime region in _S. cerevisiae_, are conserved across a variety of life <br/>
With the advent of Long-read sequencing we now have an increasing number of well assembled genomes with the subtelomeres intact <br/>
Therefore we are now primed for looking at the TLHcrs repeats and their evolution.
